            applications. Therefore Q4OS performs faster and more efficient,

            the goal is to provide long-term supported system receiving security
            updates. This is exactly what Debian base guarantees. We prefer the
            Debian development model to keep the core system as immutable as
            possible. It results in a reliable and stable system that you can
            definitely rely on ..

            Lookswitcher from the software center to get a few original desktop
            themes and a one-click tool to easily switch between them. Select a
            theme you like and enjoy the new desktop appearance.

            <b>Trinity desktop option</b><br />
            lightweight, fast, efficient, in many ways surpasses competition. In
            our opinion, a highly underrated desktop environment. Mainstream
            Linux distributions don't support Trinity at all, but we love it so
            much, that Trinity is even a dedicated download option, right after
            the default Plasma desktop.

            a unique alternative that makes possible setting up multiple desktop
            environments, typically Plasma and Trinity, side by side without
            interfering with each other. Carefully separated, ready to run as
            required, waiting for action. Just select the desired one at login

            an exclusive way to put Linux alongside Windows. Just run a setup
            wizard from within Windows and install Q4OS as easily as any other
            application. Although installed within windows, Q4OS kernel can take
            full control of the hardware. That is much more efficient than
            running a virtual machine ..

            in addition to the above and what to expect from a regular Debian
            system, Q4OS has got other interesting features. Native Q4OS
            utilities such as Desktop profiler and Software center, installers
            for third party applications, support for x86/32bit as well as ARM
            architecture and even more.
